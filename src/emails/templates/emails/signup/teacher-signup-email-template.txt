Hello {{ teacher_name }}!  

Thank you for joining the newest version of Learn with Socrates!


The Socrates Team is here to support you and your students in using Socrates to improve educational outcomes. Here is a quick overview of how to get started.

Watch our Quick Start video guide here. [YouTube link about Socrates 2.0 overview including student site and teacher site]

Remember, as your students answer questions, the Socrates engine will automatically advance your student through their learning journey - helping them advance and reinforcing where they are struggling. Each child’s journey on Socrates is unique.

We’ve created a playlist of video tutorials to help familiarize you with all the tools, features, and functionality of the Socrates platform.
